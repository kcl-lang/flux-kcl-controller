                  The KubeConfig for reconciling the controller on a remote cluster.
                  When used in combination with `KCLRunSpec.ServiceAccountName`,
                  forces the controller to act on behalf of that Service Account at the
                  target cluster.
                  If the --default-service-account flag is set, its value will be used as

                      SecretRef holds the name of a secret that contains a key with
                      the kubeconfig file as the value. If no key is set, the key will default
                      to 'value'.
                      It is recommended that the kubeconfig is self-contained, and the secret
                      is regularly updated if credentials such as a cloud-access-token expire.
                      Cloud specific `cmd-path` auth helpers will not function without adding
                      binaries and credentials to the Pod that is responsible for reconciling
